Recon Tool
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run the recon tool:

1. Open a text editor and paste the above code.
2. Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `recon_tool.py`.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the `recon_tool.py` file.
4. Run the Python script using the following command:
   ```
   python recon_tool.py
   ```
5. Follow the prompts to enter the target host IP address, starting port, and ending port.
6. The tool will scan the specified range of ports on the target host and display the open ports.

Note that this is a basic example, and recon tools can be much more complex, incorporating various techniques and modules for gathering information. Additionally, it's important to ensure that you have proper authorization and adhere to ethical guidelines when conducting any form of penetration testing or recon activities.
